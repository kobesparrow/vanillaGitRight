## Vanilla JS DropDown Redemption

##### by Mark R. Collins

In a technical assessment I was asked to create a dropdown menu using only JavaScript. It did not go well. I coded...poorly.

Believing in growth mindset and knowing I could figure it out I immediatley sat down and typed this out: a dropdown menu in pure vanilla JS. 

This mini project served to remind me to heed the importance of JavaScript fundamentals. No matter how strong I become in Vue or React or any other framework, it is all still JavaScript. Don't forget your roots.

More importantly, we all get frustrated at times. Difficult stretches of writing code are when we learn the most. Don't give up!
